SUMMARY

This application was definitely a bit easire to build after building a ToDoApp. I learned how to implement Forms and Tables in HTML and how to manipulate them in JavaScript. During this project I realized how important is code otpimization and code reduction when possible. It's so easy to get lost in variables, functions and what they do, when you have a messy code. The result of this project felt very rewarding, seeing it all in action!
